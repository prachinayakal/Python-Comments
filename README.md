# Python-Comments
In Python, comments are used to make code more readable and understandable. They come in two types: single-line comments, which start with #, and multiline comments, which can be created using triple quotes (''', """) or single/double quotes.
# Python Comments

This Python script demonstrates the usage of comments, which help improve code readability and provide explanations. Python supports two main types of comments:

1. **Single-line comments** - Start with the `#` symbol.
2. **Multiline comments** - Use triple quotes (`'''`, `"""`), single, or double quotes to span multiple lines.

## Types of Comments in Python

1. **Single-line Comment**:
   - Prefixed with `#` to annotate a single line of code.

2. **Multiline Comment**:
   - Enclosed within triple quotes (`'''`, `"""`) or optionally, single/double quotes to span across multiple lines.

## Purpose

- Single-line comments are generally used for brief annotations within code.
- Multiline comments provide more detailed explanations or documentation for code blocks.

## Usage

Download the script and run it to see how comments appear and function within Python code.
